# Guess the Flag
###### What a nightmare getting that list of flag emojis



## How to use:
Install the requirements using the following command:

```python
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
pip3 install asyncio
```

You use the slash command so that it pulls up a random flag from the list and when someone types the name of the place, they win. Configurable 10 second window before nobody gets the word.
